It's been a while since we posted and
  we thought we'd share some progress.
The biggest update is that we actually have
  a functional Unity project!
We've added a tutorial level,
  user controls, minimal vehicle AI,
  intersections with functioning street lights,
  a main menu, and minimal UI including a
  minimap and a pause button.

# Tutorial Level

The tutorial level will serve as a intro to core game mechanics
  for the player. It will not be too challenging or large.
  Currently it is 2x3 grid of city blocks, with an arbitrary
  boundary to stop the player from leaving the level. There is
  a park, school, apartment building, 3 potential food pickup points,
  and many miscellaneous buildings.

# User Controls

# Vehicle AI

Vehicles now move! They will stop and wait at intersections for green lights
and will also be able to detect other cars to avoid collisions. Currently
cars only move in a straight line and do not stop to avoid the player.

# Intersections and Street Lights

Intersections now have stop lights that change colors. Vehicles can detect
if their light is read or green and will stop to wait for a green light.

# Main Menu

A main menu is essential to any game.
It is the first screen that a player encounteres when
  beginning their first playthrough.
We've added a rather minimal main menu with
  only three options: play the next level available
  to the player, load the maps submenu, or quit the application.

While the player could initially click "Play"
  to load the next available level and begin play,
  the player could also click "Maps" to go to
  a submenu showing all the levels they can play.
Since it's only been a couple of weeks,
  we only have one map, so the map menu looks a little bare.

# In-Game UI

Similarly, we have in-game UI including a minimap
  when the player is driving their vehicle around.
One of the interesting issues was getting
  the minimap to render a simple version of the level.
To do this, a grid of quadrilaterals had to be
  placed under the tilemap mirroring the roads.
Then a second camera was added to follow the player,
  counteracting their rotation to ensure it remains
  vertically oriented, and it only displayed the grid layer
  to a texture that was mapped to the upper-left of the screen.

In addition, we added a pause menu to stop gameplay,
  and possibly return to the main menu or quit the game.
This required a similar implementation to the main menu.
A neat feature is the pause menu disables the in-game UI,
  so either the minimap is displayed or the pause menu
  but never both.

Of course, the in-game UI requires a few more bells and whistles
  including the temperature bar, an address displaying
  the destination, and perhaps the current street name.
