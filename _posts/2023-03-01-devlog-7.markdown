If you can make it, we hope to see you there.
Here is the poster we will be displaying at our booth.

Our game is now fully playable! The biggest changes include the finished Suburbs map,
which is unlockable once the player gets enough money to buy it! The shop is now fully
functional as well, with current upgrades including medical insurance so that the
player loses less money on death, an insulated bag so that food stays hot longer,
and a car (which is currently only cosmetic). This will give players a reason to play the
game for more than a couple of deliveries. See the below images for the in-game look!
