Over the weekend, we released a working version of our game.
This version is fairly minimal with a
  short tutorial level and a single city level.
You can download the game [here](https://doordashacademy.itch.io/doordash-academy).

# New features

Most of the recent work on the game involved
  implementing missing features and fixing bugs.
One of the more important missing features
  was an end level screen.
Previously, the level would continue forever
  until the player exited to the main menu
  (or alternatively the game altogether,
  presumably out of frustration).
Now, the level can end!
Currently, the main level (there is only one so far)
  technically has an infinite loop but the player
  may end at any time.
After doing so, the amount of deliveries made
  and money earned is reported.

# Analytics

We added Unity analytics to track game information
  such as downloads, daily average users, etc.
  as well as in-game statistics like deliveries completed.
Over the last three days, we've had 95 deliveries completed!
Although who knows if that's only us.
On the other hand, we had someone outside the class
  leave a review on a game on itch.
Thanks to that one person!

# In the Works

Some of the final features that we are trying
  to get working before the convention day
  include a working store (currently static)
  as well as upgrades that the player can actually buy.
In addition, we are working on a second large map,
  so stay tuned for progress on that!
