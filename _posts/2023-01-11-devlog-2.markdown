On Tuesday, January 10th, we had
  our first paper prototype demonstration
  of our game in class.
Other groups would "play" our game by interacting
  with our papers and we would show them how our
  game would respond.
In writing, the event sounds a little silly,
  but it forced us to boil our game
  down to a few key features, and
  we received our first round of feedback
  before writing any game code.

  various "screens" a player may encounter.*

Overall, the testing session went well.
While testers remarked that our UI elements could
  be more descriptive, they stated that the experience
  was intuitive, and our game idea was easy to understand.
In fact, the transitions between each paper
  took more time to explain than any actual game rule.
It was hard to demonstrate how our game required
  strategically planning routes across the map
  to achieve the best time.
Throughout the demonstration,
  testers offered a number of possible improvements to the game
  and asked multiple questions that we had not considered at the time.

### Improvements

*The menu of playable maps should have explicit map names.*

Agreed.
Not much to explain here.

*Minimap should emulate Google Maps.*

This is a driving simulator, after all.
We're not entirely sure how feasible it is to implement this over the next few months.
It may end up looking like a nondescript
 rectangle with some lines for roads.

*There should be an in-game button to view the full map.*

A must-have feature of open-world games.
Should DoorDash Academy have this feature?
On one hand, it would help the player navigate to their destination,
  but it would be more challenging to not allow them to view the map
  while driving.
Perhaps a middle ground is to allow the player
  to pull up the map only if they are completely stopped
  and it would not pause in-game time.

*There should be environmental obstacles.*

Car crashes, fallen trees, slick roads.
Quite the annoyance if you want to get to your destination on time.
While cars and pedestrians were obvious obstacles,
  we hadn't considered any of these.

*There should be a shop button.*

Being able to view the shop from the main (or sub-) menu, makes sense.
Perhaps the player would like to choose a particular map based
  on the amount of money they need for an upgrade.

*Power-ups?*

Certainly, this is a staple of many game genres.
Introducing power-ups change the mechanics of
  the game as the player would also maneuver
  to gain power-ups.
More discussion is required before we make a decision on this feature.

### Questions

*What happens when you crash?*

Two different paths here:
  (1) an arcade-style you-crash-you-die type of game
  where running into an obstacle results in a restart
  and loss of money, or
  (2) a "health" stat of some kind where you can
  take damage multiple times, either in the form of hearts or HP.
  
*What happens when we speed?*

Clearly, the objective of this game is speed.
But good citizens should follow the traffic laws, right?
Like the old GTA games, our game should have cops that
  are there to enforce laws, which leads to the next question...

*What is the interaction with cops?*

Perhaps cops, either on motorcycle or in a car,
  have a detection radius or cone.
If a player speeds or breaks the law
  within that detection zone, the cop will pursue
  them and/or a ticket will be issued, resulting
  in a financial penalty that will be applied
  at the end of the delivery.

*What happens if the temperature bar goes all the way down?*

If the player refuses to make a delivery,
  (or just drives way too slow),
  the player will fail their delivery.
They will certainly not earn a reward,
  but they may also be hit with a "not delivered" penalty.

*What happens when delivering frozen food?*

In the case, the temperature bar will most likely be inverted
  and the delivery must be made before the food gets too warm.


Most of these improvements will be incorporated
  into our game in the coming months.
We will be presenting these findings
  in class tomorrow.
Enjoy some more drawings of potential improvements.
