And that's a wrap!
We hope you had a blast at convention day.
It was great to see so many people play our game,
  especially with some last minute changes to our game.

Based on our analytics, we had quite a bit of playtime during convention day.
In total, we recorded 56 sessions averaging 4 minutes, 12 seconds each.
Players completed 147 deliveries, collided with obstacles 2,270 times,
  and recorded 162 deaths.

Players responded positively to the aesthetic of our
  game assets as well as the overall game concept.
A number of attendees remarked on the endless nature
  of the levels where you can continually make deliveries.
A few quipped about how our game was a social commentary
  on trying to strike it rich being a delivery driver.
No comment on that one.
Our controls were the most criticized component of our game,
  so it seems that we haven't completely solved that issue.

Reflecting development over the last 10 weeks,
  we found it was interesting to step through the entire product life cycle:
  taking a simple idea all the way to release with paper prototype, playtesting,
  constant feedback, and iterative improvement on our game.
Most importantly, game design it not just about development.
In particular, marketing, publishing, artwork, planning,
  are all important and take a lot of time and work,
  and take the most amount of time.
Overall, this project was a valuable experience.

Where to next?
We'll see.
Stay tuned to find out...
