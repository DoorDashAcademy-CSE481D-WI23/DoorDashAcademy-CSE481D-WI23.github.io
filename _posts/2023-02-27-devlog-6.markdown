Regarding game progess, we now have a much better player model, complete with a person and animation! 
This addresses a lot of the feedback we got during our playtesting sessions with the player being
difficult to see.

A new, much larger map is in the works. This map (called the suburbs) will be 10-20x larger than the
current city map and be a lot less dense, allowing for an easier transition into the game.
